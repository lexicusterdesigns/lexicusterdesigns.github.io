    <h1> The web is "today's main street"! </h1>
    <p> The web is "today's main street" because about 5.6 billion people are online. There are so many things we can accomplish online. Places like Github allow people to create
    an online presence that is able to reach a certian community of people. The internet is also a system of moving information, it's a fast pace, always changing place. I view the DNS 
    as a car on main street, we get in the car (DNS) and it takes us to the site we want to go to. There are different roads that make up main street, such as the client who wants to 
    use the server. But it's important for the server to know their market but also the untapped market. If you want your business to grow on main street, you have to get competitive 
    and use secure services that maybe other compaines aren't using. </p>
